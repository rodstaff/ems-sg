#EMS:  Employee Management System

This is an exercise to simulate a part of an employee management system at a company.
The following were the instructions:

"For this exercise, you will create a model for company and a model for employee.
You will also need to add authorized cars for an employee. When an employee
signs up for your company portal, you will need to associate the new employee
with the company. Also, during the signup, the user will need to input their
email address. You will then need to send the employee an email welcoming them
to the company they joined and also ask them to confirm their email
registration by clicking a link that redirects them to your app."
