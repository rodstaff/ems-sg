#ems-sg
This is a module project to simulate a part of an employee management system at a company.
A cleaned-up version of project 'EMS' (Employee Management System) using http://guides.rubyonrails.org/action_mailer_basics.html and Daniel Kehoe's Learn Ruby on Rails, Book2, Ch20. This update also uses SendGrid, a cloud-based email delivery service that greatly enhances the speed of email delivery that would otherwise be very slow.

The following are the requirements:

"For this exercise, you will create a model for company and a model for employee.
You will also need to add authorized cars for an employee. When an employee
signs up for your company portal, you will need to associate the new employee
with the company. Also, during the signup, the user will need to input their
email address. You will then need to send the employee an email welcoming them
to the company they joined and also ask them to confirm their email
registration by clicking a link that redirects them to your app."
